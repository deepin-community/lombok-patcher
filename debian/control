Description: live-rewrite classes as a JVM runs
 Lombok Patcher gives you the ability to live-rewrite classes as a JVM
 runs, either by loading as an agent during JVM bootup or by injecting
 the agent 'live' during execution.
 .
 To make this easier than fiddling with classes directly, Lombok
 Patcher offers a few 'patch scripts' to do common tasks, such as wrap
 your own code around any method call, replace methods entirely with
 your own, or add fields.
 .
 lombok.patcher also includes support for getting around the Eclipse
 OSGi container's classloader separation.
